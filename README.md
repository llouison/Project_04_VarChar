# VarChar
VarChar is a dynamic word-guessing mobile application. Users are able to:
- choose any desired category of words
- begin a timed round of the game
- one player gives hints of the displayed word while other players guess the word
- At the end of each round, the players can see how many words they got correct 
- choose to begin a new round

## Technologies Used
- React Native: to simultaneously create a performant iOS and Android mobile application
- React Navigation: to handle routing between screens
- Expo XDE: to reduce the code to simple javascript and then translate it to be built for both platforms and to publish the app
- TwinWord API: to enable dynamic search and provide word-associations for any input category

## Unsolved Problems/
- accessing the camera with react-native-camera
- connecting players through react-native-webRTC
- persisting high score data in a database
